All functionalities in homework 2D requirements are implemented, as long as there is no renaming the file created by the system,
or inserting random files into the serialSave folder, the program should work perfectly fine without throwing exceptions.

Note:
1. Matching questions can have multiple same answers. Ex: 1 or more choices from the left column can have the same answer from the right column
(hope i won't lose points on this, this can be easily modified)
2. Valid Date question allows multiple same dates
